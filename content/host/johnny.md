Johnny is a published historian and luchadore roller derby announcer which, as you no doubt noticed, makes him uniquely qualified for podcasting about films. He'll do lackluster impressions at the drop of a hat for far too long and can recite you his entire 30 page research paper on Godzilla. The capital of Nebraska is Lincoln.
